    This website is built using
    <a href="https://htmx.org/" class="text-blue-400 underline">HTMX</a>,
    <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/" class="text-blue-400 underline">AlpineJS</a>,
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-blue-400 underline">Tailwind</a>.
    <br>
    I know, it looks hella old, but everything is styled with custom tailwind.
    As of now, I am putting it on github pages, later I will migrate it to some cloud hosting thing.
    <br>
    I am planning on setting up my own NAS as well as a web server, so hopefully some day it will live there.
